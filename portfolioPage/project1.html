			<p class="lead">Analyzed ResNet architecture for image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset using 4 types of ResNet architectures: ResNet-18, ResNet-
				34, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. It concluded with ResNet50 being optimal for CIFAR-10 dataset when it comes to bottle- neck with an
				accuracy of 98.01%.</p>

			<h1 class="display-4">Introduction</h1>
			<p>In this project, we are going to build ResNet architecture
				for image classification. ResNet adds
				original input to the loss function and tackles the
				vanishing gradient problem. We will be using
				Cifar-10 dataset consisting of 60000 images with
				10 classes. We will check how ResNet adds value
				to classification problems with a number of layers
				and identity mapping.</p>

			<h1 class="display-4">Problem Statement</h1>
			<p>Our goal is to build a residual network or ResNet architecture
				capable of getting trained and predict images of the
				ciphar -10 dataset with low error rate and is time efficient.
				To understand the problem, we need answers to a couple of
				questions:</p>
			<p>1) For a small dataset such as Ciphar-10, how many layers
				are needed? Compared to ImageNet, Cifar-10 could
				be considered a baby dataset. But thatâ€™s the beauty of the
				problem. We need to check how would ResNet perform
				with such data.</p>
			<p>2) Can we make ResNet more efficient? Is it possible to
				make ResNet more efficient with simple alteration. This can
				be considered a small experimentation along with building
				of the ResNet architecture.</p>

		<div class="container" >
			<h1 class="display-4"> Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>We intend to build a ResNet architecture from scratch. The
				architecture will be used on Cifar-10 dataset. We will have
				at least two to three variations in number of layers.The variation in number of layers will allow us to examine
				how ResNet performs on a dataset when different number
				of layers are used.</p>
			<p>Also, we into to examine if simple alterations can improve
				Residual Networks performance or if we could get a lower
				error rate. This is simply for experimentation purpose.</p>
