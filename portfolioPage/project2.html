			<p class="lead">Developed a fitness application with android studio. Google Firebase was employed for user authentication and can handle 200,000
                users concurrently. Application enables users to log in, set up exercises and diet, and tracking features to track user progress.</p>

			<p>With more and more things becoming virtual, people are benefiting from
                its asynchronous nature. It saves time and everything can be tracked.
                Health and Fitness is such an area. It's absolutely necessary for people to
                keep track of their health habits, exercise routines and diet on the go
                daily. Our application will provide people to keep track of their diet,
                stream exercise videos to learn asynchronously to avoid dedicating a
                fixed time to go to fitness centers. Each user can create an account with
                a unique username and a password. They can stream exercise videos
                and log their activities to keep a track.</p>
